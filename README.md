# ISBN Verifier and Generator
A tool to generate and validate the older ISBN-10 and the newer ISBN-13 numbers of books. Its GUI is created and managed using the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). The idea for this little tool is based on the codewars kata "ISBN-10 Validation" by [nklein](https://www.codewars.com/users/nklein).
